# Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves

## Dataset Overview

The dataset, originating from Kaggle, comprises over 4,000 images extracted from Farmy & Foods' crop fields. The images feature cherry leaves, both healthy and affected by powdery mildewâ€”a fungal disease impacting various plants. The cherry plantation is a key product for the company, and ensuring the supply of high-quality produce to the market is a priority.

## Business Requirements

Farmy & Foods faces a challenge with powdery mildew affecting their cherry plantations. The current manual inspection process is time-consuming, with an employee spending 30 minutes per tree. To address this, the IT team proposed a machine learning (ML) system for instant detection of mildew in cherry leaves. The success of this initiative could potentially extend to other crops.

## Objectives

1. Differentiate between healthy and powdery mildew-infected cherry leaves.
2. Predict whether a cherry leaf is healthy or affected by powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis and Validation

**Hypothesis:** Achieve high accuracy (>97%) in distinguishing leaves with and without mildew using an ML model.

**Validation:** A balanced dataset with a 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% test split. The algorithm should recognize patterns rather than memorizing, ensuring effectiveness.

## Rationale for Data Visualizations and ML Tasks

- **Visually Differentiate:** Automate visual differences between healthy and unhealthy cherry leaves using grayscale.
  
- **Predicting Algorithm:** ML model classifies leaves as with or without mildew based on nominal categorical variables.

## ML Business Case

Stakeholders proposed the ML solution to study visual differences in leaves, expecting a match rate of over 97%. The deep convolutional neural network model performed well, providing results deployed on Heroku to streamline employee workflows.

## Data Understanding

- Images uniformly sized at 256x256 pixels.
- Augmentation simulates different viewpoints through stretching, rotating, and zooming.
- No further indexing needed for modeling due to the binary nature of the target variable.

## Modeling

**Model Architecture:**
- TensorFlow and Keras utilized for modeling.
- Sequential model with Feature Learning (convolutional layers) and Classification (dense layers).
- Filters in Feature Learning identify features like lines and color differences.
- Classification section uses a sigmoid function for binary output.
